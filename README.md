# Data-Partitioning-via-K-Means-Clustering
The script implements the k-means clustering algorithm to partition unlabeled data into clusters based on their nearest geographical location to each given clustersâ€™ centroid location using Matlab. The .m scripts can be made applicable for scenarios for which local optimums need to be determined for a given multi-variant data set. The script can be expanded and made applicable for multi-variant scenarios, in which multiple parameters need to be considered to categorize unlabeled information such as within the aerospace industries which image segmentation and remote sensing is of concern, and within the field of data sceince in which management in big data is in high demand by various business sectors.
(There is an anticipation in breaking script into defined class functions in near future...)
