# Data-Partitioning-via-K-Means-Clustering
The script implements the k-means clustering algorithm to partition unlabeled data into clusters based on their nearest geographical location to each given clustersâ€™ centroid location using Matlab. The .m scripts can be made applicable for scenarios for which local optimums need to be determined for a given multi-variant data set.
